# Part 5: Adding Media Files

This is where things get interesting. We are going to "import" a bunch of media files by using real audio files and a master JSON file media.json.

## Go To Part 5 Repository

Best way to do this is just download the repo as a zip probably.

We need to:

- Grab the media.json contents
- Download the audio files

## Media.json

Put this file in the src/ folder and import it into the initialState of the reducer

## Audio Files

Put the entire folder inside the dist folder.
